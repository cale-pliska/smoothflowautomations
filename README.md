# SmoothFlow Automations

This repository contains a simple static website for **SmoothFlow Automations**. The site is entirely client-side and can be served from any static host.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main HTML page
- `css/style.css` – site styles
- `js/main.js` – loads header and footer components

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No additional build steps are required.

You can customize the content in the HTML file or extend the styles and scripts as needed.

feature/codex
The `contact.html` page now contains placeholders for embedding a Google Form and a Calendly link, instead of a built-in contact form.
