            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="about-intro"><img src="assets/cale-sitting-on-rock.jpeg" alt="Cale sitting on a rock" class="about-photo">For the last 5 years I have been working in IT for billion-dollar companies like Amazon, Cigna, and
                Advocate Aurora to learn all the hard technical skills needed to master IT. Now, I want to serve the
                industries I care most about: Action Sports. Because of my different perspective coming into IT I have a
                way of just getting things done that is virtually unheard of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perfection, introverted, optimization, complication, poor communication, overspending, and slow are all characteristics that jump out to me when I think of IT.  I embody the very opposite characteristics in my work as an IT professional.  Speed, rapid iteration, clarity, trust, simplicity, and need-based are the pillars that I live by in this profession.  Yes, there is a time to optimize, perfect, enhance and you can't be an IT professional without mastering the elements that do make IT hard.  But 99% of the time it is overkill.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am the furthest you can get from your typical IT professional.  My career started in marketing but life was born in action sports.   I pivoted into the IT field because when you are not in IT it feels like IT is the worst thing on the planet that prevents you from doing everything you want to do.  IT was slowing me down when I started my career in marketing.  Not any more, and it won't slow you down anymore either.
