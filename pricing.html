            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p>I keep pricing straightforward so you know exactly what to expect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed-rate projects</strong> – ideal when the scope is clear and we agree on one price up front.</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly plans</strong> – perfect for ongoing work at a predictable rate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we haven't worked together before, I'll always advocate for a small or medium fixed-rate project so we can move fast and build trust.</p>
            <p>Bills and invoices are concise and transparent. I don't push complicated contracts or long-term commitments. It's all about keeping it simple, working quickly, and delivering as much value as possible.</p>
